# simple-compression-C
This is a simple compression script I wrote in C that takes in input in the form of upper and lower case characters, spaces and newlines. 
It outputs a "compressed" version of the input, Where each new occurence of a word is numbered, and each repeated occurence of a word is replaced by that number.
Exact whitespace is preserved.
